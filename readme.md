## About the Study

This repository is part of a study conducted by Ada, led by Professor Anderson Piotto. Anderson Piotto is a seasoned Java developer and educator, committed to sharing his expertise and helping others understand and apply design patterns effectively.

## How to Use

Each design pattern has its own directory containing:
- A detailed explanation of the problem it addresses.
- A Java implementation demonstrating the pattern in action.
- Example code to help you understand and apply the pattern in your own projects.
